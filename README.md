# my-dev-website-vanilla

This is a version of the project with only vanilla tools on the front end. The
original project can be found in the React version
[here](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/my-dev-website). The API on the back-end
was made by me too and can be found
[here](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/blog-api). The project would be better
with server-side rendering, because a blogging site should have a better search
engine optimisation. At some point, I should make a multi-page application from it,
but at the moment I keep the less suitable JamStack architecture according to
the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api).
Thanks to [Hajime Yamasaki Vukelic](https://github.com/foxbunny) for his constructive
criticism and for letting me know about the possibilities and advantages of vanilla
development. I will still get back to the non-vanilla versions to make these work
the same as this code. I would point you to Hajime's [vanilla-patterns](https://github.com/foxbunny/vanilla-patterns-2)
which is the inspiration behind this project and uses ideas from there.
