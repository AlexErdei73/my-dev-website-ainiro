# my-dev-website-vanilla

This is a version of the project with only vanilla tools on the front-end. The
original project can be found in the React version
[here](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/my-dev-website). The API on the back-end
was made by me too and can be found
[here](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/blog-api). The project would be better
with server side rendering, because a blogging site should have better search
engine optimisation. At some point I should make multi page application from it,
but at the moment I keep the less suitable JamStack architecture according to
the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api).
