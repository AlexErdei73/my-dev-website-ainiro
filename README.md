# my-dev-website-ainiro

This is a version of the project with the [AINIRO Magic](https://docs.ainiro.io/) back-end. The
original vanilla project, which uses my custom built express API is 
[here](https://github.com/AlexErdei73/my-dev-website-vanilla). 
I made this project from curiosity. AINIRO Magic is a backend framework, which can generate REST APIs with a few clicks from the database scheme, what you can define on a GUI as well. The system has great AI integration and has well built user authentication out of the box. The low code or no code approach is based on the [Hyperlambda](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgyI389Eb9HNlhKpF9EHXO7D1EE7_dklg) language. This is a 4th generation language, which makes possible to untilize the functionality of the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) platform much faster than the C# programming language. To learn all this in C# can take you years, but in Hyperlambda it can be days or weeks. Your productivity in Magic can be unimaginable high compared to the usual ways of back-end development methods. It adds great AI code generation and AI integration in your hands, not to mention ways to implement things, which can be lengthy and complex, like user authentication or payment integration a breeze. You can buy a simple cloud based deployment of Magic [here](https://ainiro.io).
